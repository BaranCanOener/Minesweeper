# PySweeper
A simple game of minesweeper in Python &amp; using pygame.

The size of the minefield and the number of mines can me modified via the global variables:
width = 16
height = 16
mineCount = 40.

The game also contains an engine to solve it (using simple deductions and probability estimates).
